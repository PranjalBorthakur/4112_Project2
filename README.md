#Selection Conditions in Main Memory

In this project we have implemented a query optimization algorithm for a class of queries over
an in-memory database.

We have optimized a class of scan queries over a large array of records (A). The queries apply conditions to the records, and return answers (ids of records matching all conditions) in an answer array (Updated in the same array A).
